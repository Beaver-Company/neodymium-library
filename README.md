# Neodymium
A library to extend and improve the JUnit testing framework.

## What is Neodymium?
Neodymium is the glue between today's state of the art testing technologies. It's a sophisticated approach to develop fast and meaningful tests. We take **JUnit4** as testing framework so you basically just write unit tests. Since Neodymium aims for web tests we added **Selenide**, a comprehensive and smart framework for HTML tests that is based on **Selenium** which in turn allows you to control web browsers. Then we added our **Multi-Browser** addon which enables you to run you tests in all different browser configurations either local or in the cloud. Also we have a well tested and straight forward **Test data** approach. Just write down your data sets and Neodymium will take care of it. Finally we take all the test output and put them in a nifty **Allure** report. Sounds good? Take a look at a Neodymium-Example.
